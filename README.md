# WKBlurEffect
A WKWebView with an NSVisualEffectView as a background for even more beautiful hybrid apps.

## Goal
Before Xcode 9.4 (macOS 10.13.6), there was a bug that made the ability of combining the two objects impossible. The purpose of this tiny project is to display a live demo of WKWebView and NSVisualEffectView working in harmony, as well as the possibilities of working with the two in sync. Happy coding!
